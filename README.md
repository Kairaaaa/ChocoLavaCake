Chocolava Cake

Who dosent love chocolate and cake or much better chocolava cake which has the best melted chocolate inside which flows out when you cut into the cake. This is one of my favurite reipies and it is super easy. It takes only 5-7 mins totally and it can be done in the microwave instead of taking the pain to preheat the oven and it just takes a lot of time in the oven. Do try it out and tell me how you like it.
